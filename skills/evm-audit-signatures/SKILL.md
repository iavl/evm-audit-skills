# Signature Security

## Review Focus

Security review for signatures, permits, EIP-712, and meta-transactions.

## Required Context

- `signed_payload`: signed fields and canonical encoding
- `domain_separator`: EIP-712 domain and version binding
- `nonce`: nonce, replay, and invalidation model
- `signer`: signer recovery and authorization mapping
- `chain_binding`: chain, contract, and fork binding

## Review Requirements

- test replay, malleability, expiry, and signer ambiguity

## Runtime Modes

Standalone: `python3 <suite-root>/scripts/audit_run.py init <target> --run-dir <run-dir> --domain evm-audit-signatures`. Run `next` until the next template or runtime view is ready, resolve only the generated evidence-bound templates, then use `status` and `report`.

Orchestrated: consume the Master-provided immutable routing artifacts and Screen/Deep views. Never rerun Recon or Selector in orchestrated mode.

Apply the Master contract at `<suite-root>/skills/evm-audit-master/references/check-review-contract.runtime.md` for global tri-state, reachable-path, proof-gating, and confirmed-only reporting rules. Consume only the routed check bodies; do not load the full canonical registry or generated checklist.

Related Domains (advisory only; never auto-expand direct scope): `evm-audit-access-control`, `evm-audit-chain-specific`.

## Maintenance View
- `references/checklist.md` is a generated human-readable reference view.
